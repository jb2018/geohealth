Learn about geohealth, geography and health. 

### What is geohealth

Geohealth brings together giscience and health so that we can better understand factors influencing the spatial patterns emerging of particular health or disease occurrences. The aim of this is to provide comprehensive knowledge and skillsets to critique and address a range of global health issues. Students will be introduced to a variety of topics and concepts centred around how geo-spatial information and technologies can be used for addressing health and disease. Three main facets of public health will be covered: health risk – understanding where and when risks are and who may be affected; health response & services – examining accessibility to healthcare and inequalities; and health communication & decision making – communicating risks and the role of digital information and tools in providing information and aiding the decision-making process that includes data structures and ethics.

GeoHealth, Planetary Health, Public Health, One Health?

Sixty percent of all human infectious diseases are transmitted from animals and microbes of animal origin. These ‘spill over’ due to increasing contact among wildlife-livestock-humans often driven by exponentially growing anthropogenic changes caused by human activities (e.g. changes in land use, changes in climate, changes in food security, changes in politics and changes in infrastructures (e.g. digitalisation, transportation networks, water & sanitation, etc.)) and the impacts of these activities on the environment.  

Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity that will affect the health and well-being of the population. Now more than ever we need to understand what changes are taking place spatially and temporally, locally and globally. Many health changes are complex crossing social-ecological systems (SES) that are comprised of many components distributed across scales, often compounded by different socio-economic and environmental drivers, many operating non-linearly. The circulation, transmission and evolution of diseases are driven by a range of factors (environmental factors, host-related factors and the pathogen itself) and how they interact in space and time. Geographic Information Science (GIScience), an integrative and technical science is well suited to address a range of local and global health challenges that cross social-ecological systems.

We integrate a variety of data (some novel, some volunteered, some authoritative, some big and messy) in a GIS and use a mix of spatial analysis, data science, machine learning methods and mathematical and geocomputational models to address applied research questions across a wide range of topics that include different aspects of health. Our work centers around three main facets:

    understanding the ecology of disease/health across space and time (host-pathogen-environment interactions in dynamically changing environments) and what this means for health and disease outcomes;
    how to respond, and;
    what to communicate how.

We examine how changes in environments such as climate drive health and disease dynamics as it relates to

    vector-borne diseases (e.g. mosquito-vectored diseases such as dengue and malaria; tick-vectored diseases);
    disaster epidemiology (risks pre, during and post weather risk events);
    extreme weather (e.g. heat, floods);
    food security (e.g. effect of frost-freeze events on the environment in intense agricultural cropping systems; when and where biopesticides can be used for controling agricultural pests);
    accessibility (e.g. seasonal effects of access to healthcare and the use of different modes of transport to access healthcare);
    mobility (e.g. climate-drivers and how they contribute to mobility and disease circulation and transmission);
    vulnerabilities of different populations (e.g. due to heatwaves, floods, accessibility);
    communication (e.g. data structuring for effective communication; what is being communicated)
    mental health & well-being (e.g. climate risk vulnerability & risk resilience)
    etc...
