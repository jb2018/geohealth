### What is geohealth

Geohealth brings together giscience and health so that we can better understand factors influencing the spatial patterns of health or disease occurrences. It is about understanding the where and when, why, and who may be affected so that we can figure out how to respond at a local, national or global level. Health and disease is complex and requires a dynamic approach to understanding the drivers behind the patterns that we see. Geo-spatial technologies and GIScience play a vital role in visualizing where and when diseases occur in space and time, providing context and helping us understand why they may be prevalent, who may be affected and how to address the problem potentially. We are a collaborative research and learning environment that enables us to address various health and disease issues all over the world.

### GeoHealth for Planetary Health, Global Health, Climate Health, Disaster Health, Public Health, One Health?

*60% of all human infectious diseases are transmitted from animals and microbes of animal origin. These ‘spill over’ due to increasing contact among wildlife-livestock-humans often driven by exponentially growing anthropogenic changes caused by human activities (e.g. changes in land use, changes in climate, changes in food security, changes in politics and changes in infrastructures (e.g. digitalisation, transportation networks, water & sanitation, etc.)) and the impacts of these activities on the environment. 

*17% of all infectious diseases are caused by vector-borne diseases resulting in more than 1 billion cases and more than 1 million deaths each year.

*Can you imagine walking 26km in labour? A woman dies every 2 minutes from prevatable causes during pregancy and childbirth. With 400 million people lacking basic health care, 1.6 billion living in fragile environments with little to no access to health services and more than 15 million people waiting HIV treatment, we need to address access to health services and care.

*Disasters - Each year more than 350 million people are affected by disasters resulting in over 2.6 billion people affected in the last decade. 

Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity that will affect the health and well-being of the population. Now more than ever we need to understand what changes are taking place spatially and temporally, locally and globally. Many health changes are complex crossing social-ecological systems (SES) that are comprised of many components distributed across scales, often compounded by different socio-economic and environmental drivers, many operating non-linearly. The circulation, transmission and evolution of diseases are driven by a range of factors (environmental factors, host-related factors and the pathogen itself) and how they interact in space and time. Geographic Information Science (GIScience), an integrative and technical science is well suited to address a range of local and global health challenges that cross social-ecological systems.

Geospatial information and technologies provide the necessary analytical tools useful for tackling a range of health and disease risks and outcomes. 


Our work is centered around three main facets:

    -understanding the ecology of disease/health across space and time (host-pathogen-environment interactions in dynamically changing environments) and what this means for health and disease outcomes;
    -how to respond, and;
    -what to communicate and in what format.

We examine how changes in environments such as climate and disasters drive health and disease dynamics as it relates to:

    -vector-borne diseases (e.g. mosquito-vectored diseases such as dengue and malaria; tick-vectored diseases);
    -disaster epidemiology (health risks before, during and after a disaster risk events);
    -Climate health associated with extreme weather (e.g. heat, floods);
    -food security (e.g. effect of frost-freeze events on the environment in intense agricultural cropping systems; when and where biopesticides can be used for controling agricultural pests);
    -accessibility (e.g. seasonal effects of access to healthcare and the use of different modes of transport to access healthcare);
    -mobility (e.g. climate-drivers and how they contribute to mobility and disease circulation and transmission);
    -vulnerability and coping capacity of different populations (e.g. due to heatwaves, floods, accessibility);
    -communication (e.g. data structuring for effective communication; what is being communicated; how it is being communicated)
    -mental health & well-being (e.g. climate risk vulnerability & risk resilience in the short-term and long-term)
    etc...
