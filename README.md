### What is geohealth

Geohealth brings together giscience and health so that we can better understand factors influencing the spatial patterns emerging of particular health or disease occurrences. It is about understanding the where and when, why, and who may be affected so that we can figure out how to respond at a local, national or global level. Since we mainly interact with our environments at a local level many solutions are addressed at a local level, however, during the COVID-19 pandemic we saw a global response to help curb new infections in new locations.

GeoHealth, Planetary Health, Public Health, One Health?

Sixty percent of all human infectious diseases are transmitted from animals and microbes of animal origin. These ‘spill over’ due to increasing contact among wildlife-livestock-humans often driven by exponentially growing anthropogenic changes caused by human activities (e.g. changes in land use, changes in climate, changes in food security, changes in politics and changes in infrastructures (e.g. digitalisation, transportation networks, water & sanitation, etc.)) and the impacts of these activities on the environment.  



Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity that will affect the health and well-being of the population. Now more than ever we need to understand what changes are taking place spatially and temporally, locally and globally. Many health changes are complex crossing social-ecological systems (SES) that are comprised of many components distributed across scales, often compounded by different socio-economic and environmental drivers, many operating non-linearly. The circulation, transmission and evolution of diseases are driven by a range of factors (environmental factors, host-related factors and the pathogen itself) and how they interact in space and time. Geographic Information Science (GIScience), an integrative and technical science is well suited to address a range of local and global health challenges that cross social-ecological systems.

We need to be able to integrate a variety of data and perform a mix of analyses to tackle a range of health and disease risks and outcomes. Our work is centered around three main facets:

    -understanding the ecology of disease/health across space and time (host-pathogen-environment interactions in dynamically changing environments) and what this means for health and disease outcomes;
    -how to respond, and;
    -what to communicate and in what format.

We examine how changes in environments such as climate drive health and disease dynamics as it relates to

    -vector-borne diseases (e.g. mosquito-vectored diseases such as dengue and malaria; tick-vectored diseases);
    -disaster epidemiology (risks pre, during and post weather risk events);
    -extreme weather (e.g. heat, floods);
    -food security (e.g. effect of frost-freeze events on the environment in intense agricultural cropping systems; when and where biopesticides can be used for controling agricultural pests);
    -accessibility (e.g. seasonal effects of access to healthcare and the use of different modes of transport to access healthcare);
    -mobility (e.g. climate-drivers and how they contribute to mobility and disease circulation and transmission);
    -vulnerabilities of different populations (e.g. due to heatwaves, floods, accessibility);
    -communication (e.g. data structuring for effective communication; what is being communicated)
    -mental health & well-being (e.g. climate risk vulnerability & risk resilience)
    etc...
